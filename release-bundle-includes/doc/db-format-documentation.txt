This document describes the format of the binary databases generated by 'make_db.py'.

All data is stored as integers or ASCII-encoded strings. Integers are encoded using big-endian.

HEADER
4 bytes: length of referece seq string
4 bytes: length of kmer list
4 bytes: length of position list

REFERENCE SEQ
Then follows the ASCII encoded reference seq. This is just the input seqs joined with "$" added after each sequence. (It thus works as a separator.)

KMER LIST
The kmers are 9-mers. Each entry in this list starts with a 4 byte respresentation of this 9-mer (The lowest 18 bits are used for this, with ACGT encoded as 00b, 01b, 10b and 11b, respectively.)
Next comes an integer specifying the offset in the position list (see below) where the matching ref seq index are list.

POSITION LIST
Each kmer with matches in the reference sequence has at least one entry in this list. Entries for a given kmer is stored consequtively. The last entry for each kmer has a negative sign to signify the end of the list.
